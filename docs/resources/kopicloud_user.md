Create, Update or Delete an Active Directory User

**Note:** Running this resource with `terraform apply` will create or update the AD User, and running `terraform destroy` will remove this AD User from Active Directory

## Example Usage

Create an AD User:
```
resource "kopicloud_user" "test" {
  username     = "cgomez"
  password     = "P@ssword"
  first_name   = "Carolina"
  initials     = "D"
  last_name    = "Gomez"
  display_name = "Carolina D Gomez"
  description  = "DevOps Engineer"

  change_password_next_logon = true
  password_never_expires     = false
  
  city     = "Lisbon"
  state    = "Lisbon"
  country  = "Portugal"
  street   = "Av Liberdade 245"
  zip_code = "1049"
  po_box   = "PO BOX 123"

  mobile_phone = "+351 123 456 999"
  office_phone = "+351 212 333 454"
  home_phone   = "+351 711 212 786"
  
  company       = "KopiCloud Labs"
  department    = "Laboratory"
  email_address = "carolina.gomez@kopicloud.net"
  office        = "Level 3, Office 67"
  job_title     = "DevOps Lab Engineer"
  
  profile_path         = "\\\\server\\profile\\user"
  profile_logon_script = "\\\\server\\script\\logon-user.cmd"
  
  rds_allow_logon  = true
  rds_profile_path = "\\\\rdsserver\\userprofile2"

  rds_connect_drive     = true
  rds_home_folder_drive = "R:"
  rds_home_folder_path  = "\\\\rdsserver\\homefolder2"
}
```

Return the New AD User:
```
output "OUTPUT_new_user_1" {
  description = "Created AD User"
  value       = resource.kopicloud_user.test
}
```

## Notes

**Note #1** you cannot set both `change_password_next_logon = true` and `password_never_expires = true` as is not suported by Active Directory.

**Note #2** for Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path of servers in the Profile and the RDS variables, use twice backslashes as usual. For example, instead of using `\\`, use `\\\\` and use `\\` instead of `\`
